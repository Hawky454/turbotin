  {
    "question": "Why are some tobacco's not categorized correctly?",
    "answer": "We scrape several thousand tobaccos every day and therefore categorizing each one manually would be far too time consuming. Instead we use fuzzy string matching, which is normally very good, especially with tobaccos that have unique names. However, blends with simple names or several different categorizations can cause it to slip up. If you have any feedback on how we could make this process better please let us know by emailing <a href=\"mailto:turbotinftw@gmail.com\" class=\"header-text non-mobile\" target=\"_blank\">turbotinftw@gmail.com</a>"
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the data in the price history plots mean?",
    "answer": "Each point in the graph represents the price of the tobacco when we scraped it. Dashed lines mean that the tobacco was out of stock at that time whereas a solid line means that it was in stock at that moment in time. This data is by no means complete as we only scrape twice a day and sometimes are unable to get data from a website for a period of time."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is TurboTin.com the best way to locate hard to find pipe tobaccos?",
    "answer": "You should have a multi-faceted plan that includes TurboTin.com as well as frequenting your local tobacco shops, registering with online retailers directly to get notifications and join their waitlists (if they have them), and visiting vintage tobacco tin sites like <a href=\"http://pipestud.com\">PipeStud.com</a>"
